A constant desire to learn new things and to apply them to solve challenges and build solutions drew me to a career in tech.

At the end of 2021 I joined the AWS re/Start programme and in January 2022 I became an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.

A few months later I completed a 12-week Software Engineering Bootcamp at _nology_io, where I dove deep into HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScipt, React, JAVA and Spring, among others. 

I worked on projects both individually and in a team and here are a few examples of my work:

https://github.com/n-a-z-a/punk-api-challenge  A web app on Brewdog beers
https://github.com/n-a-z-a/Calculator  A calculator
https://github.com/n-a-z-a/Game  A quiz

I am continuously exploring coding and refining and expanding my knowledge and I'm looking forward to joining a team where I can actively contribute and keep growing.
